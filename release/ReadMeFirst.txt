# YourPluginName: ReadMe

## Check, if everything is OK
Since you read this file, you unzipped the downloaded file.

The directory should contain:
1. This ReadMeFirst.txt file (in MarkDown format, you can rename it in ReadMeFirst.md for a better view)
2. LICENSE and LICENSE-AGPL-3.0.txt, the licenses
3. a directory called YourPluginName.vst3 (the VST3 plugin)
4. the Standalone application (Windows: YourPluginName.exe, macOS: YourPluginName.app, Linux: YourPluginName)
5. (macOS only) YourPluginName.component (the AU plugin)

## Installation

### Windows
Copy the directory YourPluginName.vst3 to C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3

### Mac VST3
Copy the directory YourPluginName.vst3 to
/Users/yourUSERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3

### Mac AU
Copy YourPluginName.component to
/Users/yourUSERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components

The macOS version is not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet. If macOS reports that the
plugin is damaged or cannot be opened, remove the quarantine flag in the Terminal, e.g.
xattr -cr ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/YourPluginName.vst3

### Linux
Copy the directory YourPluginName.vst3 to
/home/yourUSERNAME/.vst3/

Done! Start your DAW and let it rescan the plugins.
The Standalone application runs without a DAW: audio input -> YourPluginName -> audio output.

Have fun!

YourName
